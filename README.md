# Predicting-Heart-Disease

Objective: To predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques.

Approach: Used a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository containing 303 patients with 14 attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Conducted data preprocessing, including scaling and feature selection, to optimize the model's performance. Applied a variety of supervised learning algorithms including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forests. Evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Used feature importance techniques to identify the most important predictors of heart disease.

Results: Achieved an accuracy of 76% on the test set using a random forest classifier. Identified age, chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and exercise-induced angina as the most important predictors of heart disease. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting the likelihood of heart disease and can be used by healthcare professionals to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies for patients.
